# hackhour
==========

Topics are wide ranging. Coding & discussion will be **lively & informal**. If you want to participate, pop a few beers and have some light hearted fun in the dwindling hours of a Friday afternoon, then drop round (ko ~4pm Fridays).

If you want to run a session, then email me: amosfolarin@gmail.com

Each week's hackhour topic will live in a folder in this repo... we typically vote on the next hackhour topic at the end the previous week. List of suggested sessions are listed in [./Suggestions.md](./Suggestions.md)

>Dean Wampler, Ph.D. Typesafe dean.wampler@typesafe.com @deanwampler
>This workshop demonstrates how to write and run Apache Spark version 1.4 applications. You can run the examples and exercises locally on a workstation, on Hadoop (which could also be on your workstation), or both.
>If you are most interested in using Spark with Hadoop, the Hadoop vendors have preconfigured, virtual machine "sandboxes" with Spark included. See their websites for information.
